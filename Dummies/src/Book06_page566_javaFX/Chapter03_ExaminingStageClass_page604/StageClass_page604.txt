/*
A stage, which is represented by the Stage class, is the topmost container in
which a JavaFX user interface appears. In Windows, on a Mac, or in Linux, a stage
is usually a window. On other types of devices, such as a smartphone or tablet, the
stage may be the full screen or a tiled region of the screen.

When a JavaFX application is launched, a stage known as the primary stage is automatically created.

A reference to this stage is passed to the application’s start
method via the primaryStage parameter:

> @Override public void start(Stage primaryStage) {
    // primaryStage refers to the
    // application's primary stage.
  }

You can then use the primary stage to create the application’s user interface
by adding a scene, which contains one or more controls or other user-interface
nodes.

!!! Note:
In many cases, you will need to access the primary stage outside the scope of
the start method. You can easily make this possible by defining a class field and
using it to reference the primary stage. You see an example of how to do that later
in this chapter, in the section “Switching Scenes.”
!!!

The primary stage initially takes on the default characteristics of a normal
windowed application, which depends on the operating system within which the
program will run.

You can, if you choose, change these defaults to suit the needs
of your application. At the minimum, you should always set the window title.

You may also want to change such details as whether the stage is resizable
and various aspects of the stage’s appearance.
