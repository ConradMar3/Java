Up to this point in this book, all the programs are console-based,
like something right out of the 1980s. Console-based Java programs have their place,
especially when you’re just starting with Java. But eventually you’ll want
to create programs that work with a graphical user interface (GUI).

This chapter gets you started in that direction using a Java GUI package called
JavaFX to create simple GUI programs that display simple buttons and text labels.
Along the way, you learn about several of the key JavaFX classes that let you create
the layout of a GUI.

Prior to JavaFX, the main way to create GUIs in Java was through the Swing API.
JavaFX is similar to Swing in many ways, so if you’ve ever used Swing to
create a user interface for a Java program, you have a good head start at learning
JavaFX.

Oracle has announced that JavaFX will eventually replace Swing. Although Swing
is still supported in Java 8 and will be supported for the foreseeable future, Oracle
is concentrating new features on JavaFX.
Eventually, Swing will become obsolete.
