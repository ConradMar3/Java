Custom character classes can also specify ranges of letters and numbers, like this:

Enter regex: [a-z][0-5]
Enter string: r2
Match.
Enter string: b9
Does not match.

Here the string can be two characters long. The first must be a character from
a–z, and the second must be 0–5.

You can also use more than one range in a class, like this:

Enter regex: [a-zA-Z][0-5]
Enter string: r2
Match.
Enter string: R2
Match.

Here the first character can be lowercase a–z or uppercase A–Z.

You can use ranges to build a class that accepts only characters that appear in real
words (as opposed to the \w class, which allows underscores):

Enter regex: [a-zA-Z0-9]
Enter string: a
Match.
Enter string: N
Match.
Enter string: 9
Match.
