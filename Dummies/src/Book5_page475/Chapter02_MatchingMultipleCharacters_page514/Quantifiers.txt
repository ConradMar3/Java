Quantifiers:

Regex Matches the Preceding Element:

?       Zero times or one time
*       Zero or more times
+       One or more times
{n}     Exactly n times
{n,}    At least n times
{n,m}   At least n times but no more than m times

To use a quantifier, you code it immediately after the element you want it to apply
to. Hereâ€™s a version of the Social Security number pattern that uses quantifiers:

Enter regex: \d{3}-\d{2}-\d{4}
Enter string: 779-48-9955
Match.
Enter string: 483-488-9944
Does not match.

Simply duplicating elements rather than using a quantifier is just as easy, if not
easier. \d\d is just as easy as \d{2}.

The ? quantifier lets you create an optional element that may or may not be pres-ent in the string.
Suppose you want to allow the user to enter Social Security numbers without the hyphens.
You could use this pattern:

Enter regex: \d{3}-?\d{2}-?\d{4}
Enter string: 779-48-9955
Match.
Enter string: 779489955
Match.
Enter string: 779-489955
