You can use parentheses to create groups of characters to apply other regex
elements to, as in this example:

Enter regex: (bla)+
Enter string: bla
Match.
Enter string: blabla
Match.
Enter string: blablabla
Match.
Enter string: bla bla bla
Does not match.


Here the parentheses treat bla as a group, so the + quantifier applies to the entire
sequence. Thus, this pattern looks for one or more occurrences of the sequence
bla.
Here’s an example that finds U.S. phone numbers that can have an optional area
code:

Enter regex: (\(\d{3}\)\s?)?\d{3}-\d{4}
Enter string: 555-1234
Match.
Enter string: (559) 555-1234
Match.
Enter string: (559)555-1239
Match.

Suppose that droids named following the pattern \w\d-\w\d must have the same
digit in the second and fifth characters. In other words, r2-d2 and b9-k9 are valid
droid names, but r2-d4 and d3-r4 are not.

Here’s an example that can validate that type of name:

Enter regex: \w(\d)-\w\1
Enter string: r2-d2
Match.
Enter string: d3-r4
Does not match.
Enter string: b9-k9
Match.

Here \1 refers to the first capture group. Thus, the last character in the string must
be the same as the second character, which must be a digit.
