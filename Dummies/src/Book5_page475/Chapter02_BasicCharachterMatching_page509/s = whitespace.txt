The \s class matches white-space characters including spaces, tabs, newlines,
returns, and backspaces.
This class is useful when you want to allow the user to
separate parts of a string in various ways, as in this example.
(Note that in the fourth line, I use the Tab key to separate abc from def.)

Enter regex: ...\s...
Enter string: abc def
Match.
Enter string: abc def
Match.

The \s class also has a counterpart: \S.

If you want to limit white-space characters to actual spaces, use a space in the
regex, like this:
Enter regex: ... ...
Enter string: abc def
Match.
Enter string: abc def
Does not match.
