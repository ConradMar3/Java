The last set of predefined classes is \w and \W.
The \w class identifies any character thatâ€™s normally
used in words, including uppercase and lowercase letters, digits,
and underscores. An example shows how all that looks:

Enter regex: \w\w\w\W\w\w\w
Enter string: abc def
Match.
Enter string: 123 456
Match.
Enter string: 123_456
Does not match
