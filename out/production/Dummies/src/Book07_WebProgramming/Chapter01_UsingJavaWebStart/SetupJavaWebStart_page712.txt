1. >> Create a JAR file that contains the Java application you want to run via
      Java Web Start:

      For information about how to create a JAR file, refer to Book 3, Chapter 8. For
      the purposes of this chapter, I assume you’ve created a JAR file named
      ClickMe.jar for the ClickMe application.

2. >> Create a JNLP file that specifies the necessary information to enable the
      program to run from Java Web Start:

      Among other things, the JNLP file must contain the location of the application’s
      JAR file. For the application illustrated in this chapter, we’ll name the JNLP file
      clickme.jnlp.

      For more information about creating a JNLP file, see the next section.

3. >> Create an HTML file that contains a link to the JNLP file:

      The HTML file will be displayed in the user’s browser. When the user clicks the
      link to the JNLP file, the application defined in the JNLP file is run. For this
      chapter, the HTML file will be named clickme.html.

      For more information about creating the HTML file, see the section “Creating
      an HTML File to Launch a Java Application” later in this chapter.

4. >> Copy the JAR, JNLP, and HTML files to the appropriate folders on the
      web server:

      You can use any FTP client (such as FileZilla) to upload the files to your web
      server, or you can use your web host’s file management utilities to upload the
      files. In most cases, the JAR, JNLP, and HTML file will all reside in the same
      folder on the web server. However, it is possible to save each of the files to a
      different folder.
