/*
Java Web Start works by providing a web link to a special file called a JNLP file.
This file contains all the information necessary to download and launch a Java
application on an end user’s computer. When the user clicks the link to the JNLP
file, the web server reads the contents of the JNLP file, downloads the Java program,
and runs it on the user’s computer.

With Java Web Start, the Java program does not run within the user’s web browser
environment. Instead, Java Web Start runs the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) locally
on the user’s computer, and then runs the application within the JVM.

An older technology called applets allows Java programs to run directly within a
web browser. Doing so requires the assistance of a browser plugin, which can lead
to compatibility issues between different plugin versions. Browser manufacturers have recently
announced that they will no longer include plugins to support
applets, and Oracle officially deprecated applets in Java 9.

! - If the user’s computer does not have the Java runtime installed (or has an
    incorrect version of the runtime), Java Web Start offers to download and install
    the Java  runtime automatically.

!! - Ordinarily, applications that run via Java Web Start are prevented from performing certain
     operations that might create security risks for the user, such as reading
     and writing files on the user’s file system or accessing the user’s local network.
     You can configure Java Web Start security features to allow these types of activity,
     but doing so is beyond the scope of this book. For more information, search the
     web for Java Web Start.
