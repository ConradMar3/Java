The \d class represents a digit and is often used in regex patterns to validate input data.
Here’s a simple regex pattern that validates a U.S. Social Security number,
which must be entered in the form xxx-xx-xxxx:

Enter regex: \d\d\d-\d\d-\d\d\d\d
Enter string: 779-54-3994
Match.
Enter string: 550-403-004
Does not match.

Note that the \d class has a counterpart:
\D. The \D class matches any character that is not a digit.
Here’s a first attempt at a regex for validating droid names:

Enter regex: \D\d-\D\d
Enter string: R2-D2
Match.
Enter string: C2-D0
Match.
Enter string: C-3PO
Does not match.
