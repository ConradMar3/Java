In regular expressions, certain characters have special meaning. What if you want
to search for one of those special characters? In that case, you escape the character
by preceding it with a backslash. Hereâ€™s an example:

Enter regex: \(\d{3}\) \d{3}-\d{4}
Enter string: (559) 555-1234
Match.
Enter string: 559 555-1234
Does not match.

Here \( represents a left parenthesis, and \) represents a right parenthesis. Without the backslashes,
the regular expression treats the parenthesis as a grouping element.
