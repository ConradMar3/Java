Character Classes:

Regex   Matches:
.       Any character
\d      Any digit (0–9)
\D      Any non-digit (anything other than 0–9)
\s      Any white-space character (space, tab, new line, return, or backspace)
\S      Any character other than a white-space character
\w      Any word character (a–z, A–Z, 0–9, or an underscore)
\W      Any character other than a word character


The period is like a wildcard that matches any character, as in this example:

Enter regex: c.t
Enter string: cat

Enter string: cot

Enter string: cart
Does not match.
