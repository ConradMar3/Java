/*

» All the Scene class constructors require that you specify the root node.

   You can change the root node later by calling the setRoot method, but it’s not
   possible to create a scene without a root node.

» You might be wondering why the root node is an instance of the Parent
  class rather than an instance of the Node class.

   The Parent class is actually a subclass of the Node class, which represents
   a node that can have child nodes.
   There are several other subclasses of Node, which represent nodes that
   can’t have children; those nodes can’t be used as the root node for a scene.

» You can set the scene’s initial size when you create it by specifying the
  Width and Height parameters.

   If you don’t set the size, the scene will determine its own size based on its content.

» You can retrieve the size of the scene via the 'getHeight' and 'getWidth' methods.

   There are no corresponding set methods that let you set the height or width.

» In general, the size of the scene determines the size of the stage,
  provided that that scene is not smaller than the minimum size specified for
  the stage or larger than the maximum size.

» If the user resizes the stage, the size of the scene is resized accordingly.
