/*
 Like the Stage class, the Scene class is fundamental to JavaFX programs. In
 every JavaFX program, you use at least one instance of the Scene class to hold
 the user-interface controls that your users will interact with as they use your
 program.

 Table 3-2 lists the more commonly used constructors and methods of the Scene
 class:

   > Scene(Parent root)                                 -- Creates a new scene with the specified root node
   > Scene(Parent root, double width, double height)    -- Creates a new scene with the specified root node,
                                                           width, and height

   > double getX()                                     -- Gets the horizontal position of the scene
   > double getY()                                     -- Gets the vertical position of the screen
